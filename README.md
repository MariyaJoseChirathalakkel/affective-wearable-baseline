# Affective-Wearable-Baseline Analysis

This repository serves as a technical pilot for my 2026 research proposal. By utilizing the multimodal WESAD dataset, I am developing a pipeline for the extraction and analysis of Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV). The objective is to validate stress-classification architectures before adapting them to detect sensory dysregulation and imminent meltdowns in autistic populations.


### Dataset Sources

Signal processing and feature extraction from wearable sensor data (WESAD dataset) for stress detection.
