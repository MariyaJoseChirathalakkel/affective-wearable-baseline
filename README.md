Applying a neuro-affirming lens to affective computing, this pilot study utilizes multimodal physiological data to refine early-detection algorithms. By investigating the correlation between biometric signals (EDA/HRV) and emotional states, this project builds the technical foundation for non-intrusive systems designed to support self-regulation and prevent sensory overload in autistic adults.
